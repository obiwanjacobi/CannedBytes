**Project Description**
A C# code repository for backing other codeplex open source projects I'm doing.

## CannedBytes.IO

Contains enhancements on the System.IO namespace. Some Stream variations are available.

## CannedBytes.Media.IO

Implements a generic serialization mechanism based on the RIFF/IFF specification. Uses MEF.
